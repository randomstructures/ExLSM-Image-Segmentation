# ExLSM-Image-Segmentation

This is a work in progress. The ultimate goal is to implement a tool for automated neuron tracing in expansion lightsheet microscopy volumes.

This repository contains
- machine learning models for image segmentation
- i/o and utility functions
- tools to split images into tiles and reassemble then
- tools to perform image augumentation suited for microscopy samples
