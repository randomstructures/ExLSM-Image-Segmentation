"""Implementation of a Unet architecture for 3D microscopy data

The original Unet architecure: "U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical
Image Segmentation" by Ronneberger et al.
3D Implementation as demonstrated in "3D U-Net: Learning Dense Volumetric
Segmentation from Sparse Annotation" by Ozg√ºn et al. 
Implementation details inspired by the model code a the NVIDIA Deep Learning Example [UNet_Medical](https://github.com/NVIDIA/DeepLearningExamples/tree/master/TensorFlow2/Segmentation/UNet_Medical)

import tensorflow as tf 

""" When tf.keras.Model is subclassed:

Use the constructor method __init__ to instantiate the layers as variables of the model instance
layer parameters are specified but the input shape is passed in the call function


define the method call() providing the input arguments for evaluation of the model
pass them stepwise through the model layers
return the output of the block / model
