"""Implementation of a Unet architecture for 3D microscopy data

The original Unet architecure: "U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical
Image Segmentation" by Ronneberger et al.
3D Implementation as demonstrated in "3D U-Net: Learning Dense Volumetric
Segmentation from Sparse Annotation" by Ozg√ºn et al. 
Implementation details inspired by the model code a the NVIDIA Deep Learning Example [UNet_Medical](https://github.com/NVIDIA/DeepLearningExamples/tree/master/TensorFlow2/Segmentation/UNet_Medical)
